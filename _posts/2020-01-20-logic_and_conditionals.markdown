Logic and Conditionals was acually quite enjoyable for me. I did have previous experience with "boolean expressions" but it also just seems to be the most logical part of coding thus far(no pun intended). Being able to create these 'if this occurs then do this' statements is easy to wrap my head around becuase it is very parallel with real life. And I guess I think in "if statements" in real life quite often, i.e "If my wifi goes out, then I will go to starbucks" etc. Plus using the comparitive operators(==, >=, etc.) is nice, again because it's someting we do all the time outside of coding. But, sometimes the statements can get out of hand very quickly and they start to look rather ugly, but it's SUPER satisfying to take the "ugly" statement and refactor it until it looks "elegant", or as elegant as I could acheive at that moment.
