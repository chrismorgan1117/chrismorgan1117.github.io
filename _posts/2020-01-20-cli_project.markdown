Boooooooyyyyyy was this one tough. The amount of planning and research and googling and video watching that went into this was IMMENSE. It was also extremely frustrating at times, particularly at the very beginning. Getting started was easily the hardest part. There's just something about all the empty files that's oddly daunting to me. But, once you start putting your fingers to keys it slowly gets easier. That is until everythings broken and you have to look for the missing end or whatever error it may be. The pattern I found myself in was: working to broken to mental-breakdown to coffee to more coffee to despair to I dont know how but it is working and I'm fine with that. Which I expected, it being the first project and all, but good lord was it taxing at times. 

So, eventually I decided to create a CLI gem that provides you a list of events happening soon(next day or two) in my hometown(Houston). Once I found the ideal website to scrape, I started to plan out as much as I could before going to any resources. I should've just gone to resources immediatley as it would've saved me some serious time, but I really wanted to test myself. I went through at least 4 or 5 renditions that were scrapped because I didnt like the way they worked or I broke something and couldn't figure out what or where so I'd start over. But, it helped me understand the code at a deeper level and each new version went further and further until the last one worked as intended. And the last one working may have been the most relieving moment of my life. And now if I'm ever in need of a spontaneous event around me I've got a gem for it.
