I've actually been asking myself this question a lot recently. Not in a "questioning why I'm doing this" way but in a "why do I enjoy this so much" kind of way.  And I've come to the conclusion that it's just super interesting to me...virtually everything I use in my day to day life uses software, from cars to guitar pedals, there's software somewhere in there doing something that is absolutely vital to the performance of whatever item it runs within. 

To help whomever is reading this understand why I find programming so cool, I'll give a bit of background info on myself. For a vast majority of the quarter of a century I've been alive I wanted to follow my fathers' footsteps and practice Intellectual Property Law, all the way up until I interned at his Firm and very quickly realized that I could not see myself being happy while doing that for the rest of my life(no offense to any IP lawyers out there but that place felt devoid of life). And after that earth-shattering realization I figured I would just not go to law school and put my B.S.E.E to use and be an electrical engineer somewhere. But, turns out designing PCBs is undoubtably more soul-sucking than working in the boring dystopia of the firm. So then I was stuck. I didn't know what else I could do that I wouldn't despise going to do every day, or if there even was something that I wouldn't grow to detest. And then I found IT, just enough of "how things work" and would give me some time to figure out what I wanted to do. But, along the IT path I ran into SQL. I just sat and stared at my laptop screen filled with lines of what I knew was code but I might as well have been interpreting hieroglyphs. I had zero idea what anything meant, but I was hell-bent on figuring it out. And slowly but surely it started to click. And I was hooked. It became a hobby, something I genuinely looked forward to doing every day, and I hadn't fallen for something like that since I first learned guitar in 3rd grade. 

So that's why I want to be a Software Engineer. I walked down paths I hadn't explored and at the end of it I found something I didn't know I wanted to be so bad.
